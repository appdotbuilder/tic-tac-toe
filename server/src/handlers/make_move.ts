    // 4. Update the board with the player's move
    // 5. Check for win conditions (3 in a row, column, or diagonal)
    // 6. Check for draw condition (board full with no winner)
    // 7. Switch to the next player if game continues
    // 8. Update game status and result accordingly
    // 9. Return the updated game state
